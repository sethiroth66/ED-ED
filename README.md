#### Elite Dangerous : Exploration Dashboard

---

## Setup
Install all the modules required to get the system up and running:  
`npm install`

Run the following to start the 'dashboard'. Make sure Elite Dangerous is running first.  
`npm start`

For a demo/sample instead of trying to tail on any active session logs, you can append `--demo`
`npm start --demo`

To attempt to automatically open the browser, append `--browser`
`npm start --browser`

For an instant demo in the browser, obviously combine the two
`npm start --demo --browser`

You should then be able to open the view to dashboard in the browser
http://localhost:3000
